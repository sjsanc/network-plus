**A. Summarise Common Networking Attacks**
- **CIA Triad**
	- *Confidentiality*
	- *Integrity*
	- *Availability*
- **Security Policies** 
	- making a system more secure via security controls is called *hardening* 
- **Concepts**
	- *Vulnerability* - a weakness that can lead to a security breach
	- *Threat* - the potential for a *threat agent* or actor to exercise a weakness via a *threat vector*
	- *Exploit* - the specific means of using a vulnerability
	- *Risk* - likelihood or impact of a threat actor exercising a vulnerability
	- *Zero-day* - a vulnerability exploited before vendor can patch it
	- *Exfiltrate* - to steal information from a system
	- *Footprinting* - gathering information about a system
	- *Eavesdropping* - (sniffing) capturing and reading packets
	- *Spoofing* - impersonating or disguising identity (such as phishing)
	- *Man-in-the-middle* - transparently intercepting traffic
- **IP Spoofing**
	- Common in DDoS, where the origin IP in the packet is forged
- **ARP Cache Poisoning**
	- ??
- **DNS Poisoning**
	- pharming
- **DoS Attacks**
	- *Resource Exhaustion*
	- *Blinding* - overload a logging or alerting system
- **DDoS Attacks**
	- *handlers, masters, herders*
	- *BOTNETS!*
	- *SYN flood*
- **DRDoS Attack (amplification)**
	- *Smurf Attack*
	- *Bogus DNS queries*
	- *NTP*

**B. Explain the Characteristics of VLANs**
- **Network Segmentation**
	- The process of determining which parts of the network are accessible to each other via *access controls*.
	- Can be enforced via VLANs, VPNs, subnets, and virtualisation.
	- Firewalls can be used to apply traffic rules.
	- An *air gap* is a physical, rather than logical, separation of hosts.
- **Virtual LANs (VLANs)**
	- Hosts on the same switch are in the same broadcast domain, thus vulnerable to excessive broadcast traffic and malware such as ARP spoofing.
	- VLANs create separate broadcast domains, security zones, and help with QoS by segregating traffic (i.e. putting VoIP on a separate VLAN).
	- Layer 3 swtiches use *application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)*
- **Static and Dynamic VLAN Membership**
	- *Static* - port ranges on a switch are assigned to a VLAN via the web interface. 
	- *Dynamic* - hosts are assigned to VLAN via some feature of the host
- **VLAN Assignment Issues**
	- Ensure network resources are available to the VLAN (like DNS server)
	- Ensure VLAN-to-VLAN communication is enabled if needed.
- **Trunking and IEEE 802.1Q**
	- Trunk lines connect switches in a network.
	- IEEE 802.1Q (or Inter-Switch Link from Cisco) defines a VLAN tag (VID) inserted in the Ethernet frame (between the source address and EtherType fields), containing the VID and priority (for QoS).
- **Tagged and Untagged Ports**
	- *Untagged*, or *access* or *host*, will only connect to a single VLAN.
		- If frame is addressed to host on same VLAN, no tag is added
		- If frame is addressed over trunk, the 802.1Q tag is added
		- If a tagged frame is received, it strips the tag.
	- Whereas a *tagged* port operates as a trunk, capable of transporting traffic to multiple VLANs.
- **Default VLAN and Native VLAN**
	- The *default VLAN* is VID 1. This should always be changed.
	- The *native VLAN* is one which any untagged traffic is sent, and is by default the default VLAN. Users should change the native VLAN (which exists to provide backwards comparability for non-VLAN traffic) to any other VID.
	- Unused ports should be disabled and assigned to a *black hole VLAN* that is inaccessible from anywhere else.
	- A *VLAN mismatch error* occurs when the native VLAN ID is different between switches.
- **VLAN Hopping Attack**
	- An attacker inserts two tags into the frame. The first header gets stripped and the frame gets forwarded to the second. Thus, a DoS can occur between unconnected VLANs. Can be mitigated by setting the native VLAN ID to an inaccessible VLAN.
	- An attacker can spoof a switch by creating a trunk port if the trunk ports aren't pre-configured.
- **VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP)**
	- VTP is Cisco proprietary. Standards-based is **Multiple VLAN Registration Protocol (MVRP)**
	- Allows VLANs to be configured across multiple switch devices without configuring each manually.
	- Switches are assigned *server* and *client* management roles and grouped into *management domains*. 
	- *Pruning* means removing a VLANs traffic from a trunk line.
	- *Multiple Spanning Trees Protocol (MSTP)* is used to deny access to specific VLANs in a tree network.
- **Guide to Implementing VLAN Infra.**
	- Assign devices to VLANs by type (VoIP, wired, wireless, printers etc).
	- Use VLANs for security zones. 
	- Aim for a max of 250 hosts in a VLAN (/24 subnet).
	- Use VLANs for each floor to minimise trunk traffic.
	- Don't use VLAN 1.

**C. Explain the Characteristics of NAT and Port Forwarding**
- *Zone* - an area of the network where security config is the same.
- *Firewall* - filters traffic passing via network via *access control list (ACL)* rules.
- **DMZ** 
	- acts as a perimeter network so that network nodes never directly interface with the internet, by acting as a proxy. 
	- Hosts within a DMZ (mail server, web server) are un-trusted by internal network hosts as they may be compromised. 
	- *Screened subnet* - a DMZ consisting firewalls on either side. 
	- *3-leg subnet* - a single firewall handles in and outbound traffic, with the DMZ held to one side.
	- *Screened host*
	- *Soho DMZ*
- **NAT**
	- Network Address Translation allows a firewall to map addresses between outside and inside interfaces, allowing real host IP addresses to be obscured. 
	- With static NAT, mapping is fixed. With dynamic NAT, mappings are bound and released for each session. 
	- TODO: explore NAT further. 
- **PAT**
	- Port Address Translation.
	- Multiple hosts on a network can connect to an external web server via the same firewall by using a different port. The web server sees traffic coming from a single host (the firewall). Traffic between the two is mapped via the PAT mapping tables. 
- **Port Forwarding (DNAT)**
	- Destination NAT
	- Traffic destined for one port is redirected to another.
