	- *Router*
		- Routes packets between networks (L3)
		- Handles addressing and routing tables
		- Connects over LAN and WAN
	- *Switch*
		- Forwards frames within a network (L2)
		- Uses MAC addressing and VLAN for traffic segmentation
		- Connects computers within a local network, such as an office
	- *Intrusion Detection System (IDS)*
		- Monitors network traffic for suspicious activity
		- Signature-based or anomaly-based
		- E.g. detecting port scanners or malware
	- *Load Balancer*
		- Distributes network traffic across servers
		- Increases availability and reliability of services
		- Either at Transport (L4) or Application (L7)
	- *Proxy*
		- Intermediary between a client and server
		- Used for caching, content filtering, anonymity, security
		- E.g. a web proxy for hiding client IP address
	- *Network-attached Storage (NAS*
		- File-level shared storage over the network
		- **SMB** or **NFS** protocols
	- *Storage Area Network (SAN)*
		- Provides block-level storage to servers

- **Applications**
	- *Content Delivery Network (CDN)*
		- Distributes content delivery across multiple servers
		- Improves performance of web servers by enabling geolocation
- **Functions**
	- *Virtual Private Network (VPN)*
		- Provides secure connection over a public network (i.e. internet)
		- E.g. accessing corporate network over VPN tunnel
	- *Quality of Service (QoS)*
		- Traffic shaping and policing
		- Prioritise certain traffic (e.g. VoIP)
		- Minimise delay (latency) and variation (jitter) of packets
		- **Models**
			- *DiffServ*
				- Differentiated Service
				- Prioritise based on classes in the IP header
			- *IntServ*
				- Integrated Service
				- Guarantees a level of service
	- *Time-to-Live (TTL)*
		- IP packet header field that decreases by 1 for each hop (router)
		- Limits the lifespan of a packet over the network to prevent permanent circulation

**Cloud Concepts**
- *Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV)*
	- Network services (firewalls, routers, LB etc) are visualised via software
	- Decouples network functions from hardware
- *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)*
	- A logically isolated network in the cloud
	- IP addresses, subnets, routing tables, network gateways
- *Network Security Groups*
	- Used to control outbound/inbound traffic to network interfaces (NIC) or virtual machines in a VPC.
	- Allow or deny traffic based on IP address, ports and protocols
- *Network Security Lists*
	- Like NSGs but applied at the subnet level. 
- **Cloud Gateways**
	- *Internet Gateway*
		- Enables communication between instances in a VPC and the internet. 
	- *Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway*
		- Enables private subnets to access the internet without exposing themselves
- **Cloud Connectivity Options**
	- *VPN*
		- Enables secure connection between on-premise network and a cloud environment over the internet.
	- *Direct Connect*
		- Dedicated, private connection on-premise and datacenter
- **Deployment Models**
	- *Public*
		- Cloud resources are shared between multiple tenants
	- *Private*
		- Cloud resources belong to a single tenant
	- *Hybrid*
		- Utilising both models. 
		- E.g. sensitive data stored on a private cloud
- **Service Models**
	- *Software as a Service (SaaS)*
		- Provides application software over the internet
		- E.g. Gmail
	- *Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)*
		- Provides infrastructure (VM, storage, networking) over the internet
		- E.g. AWS EC2
	- *Platform as a Service (PaaS)*
		- Provides hardware over the network with minimum abstraction
		- E.g. Google App Engine
- *Scalability*
	- The ability to expand or reduce computing capability
- *Elasticity*
	- The speed at which expansion occurs
- *Multi-tenancy*
	- A cloud configuration where a single physical volume is shared between multiple tenants as isolated logical volumes.
